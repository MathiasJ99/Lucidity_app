        <h2>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>A business that supports our website, products and services may be located outside of New Zealand (the country where we are incorporated) and also outside of the country where you are located.  This means that the personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored in, a country outside of New Zealand and the country where you are located. </p>
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), your personal information may be transferred outside of the EEA.   Under the GDPR, the transfer of personal information to a country outside the EEA may take place where the European Commission has decided that the country ensures an adequate level of protection.  In the absence of an adequacy decision, we may transfer personal information if other appropriate safeguards are in place. </p>
        <p>Where we transfer personal information outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EEA data, or to a third party where approved transfer mechanisms are in place to protect your personal information (e.g. by entering into the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.  For further information, please contact us at enquiries@PLACEHOLDER.com. </p>
        <p>Some of the personal information we collect is processed in New Zealand.  New Zealand is recognised by the European Commission as a country that has an adequate level of data protection and we rely on this decision in transferring personal information to New Zealand. </p>

    <div class="container px-4 py-5">
        <h2>PROTECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>As required by applicable law, we will take steps to keep your personal information safe from loss, unauthorised activity, or other misuse.  We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks inherent in processing personal information. </p>
        <p>You play an important role in keeping your personal information secure by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used in relation to our products and services.  You should not disclose your password to third parties.  Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container px-4 py-5">
        <h2>ACCESSING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Subject to certain grounds for refusal under applicable law, you have the right to access your personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information.  Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates. </p>
        <p>Where you request a correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change your personal information, we will make the correction.  In all other cases, we will take reasonable steps to make a note of the personal information that was the subject of your correction request. </p>
        <p>If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at enquiries@PLACEHOLDER.com.  Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information to be corrected and the correction that you are requesting). </p>

        <h2>LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Our lawful basis for processing (as that term is defined in the GDPR) personal information that we collect, use and disclose depends on the personal information collected and the context in which we collect it. </p>
        <p>Generally, we collect personal information from you where we have your consent, where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, or where processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). </p>
        <p>Where we process personal information based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. </p>
        <p>Despite the above, we may process your personal information where such processing is necessary for compliance with applicable laws. </p>
        <p>If you have any question about the legal basis on which we process personal information or need further information, please contact us at enquiries@PLACEHOLDER.com. </p>

        <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your browsing device, e.g. a computer or smartphone, when you visit a website.  Cookies can be recognised by the website that downloaded them, or by other websites that use the same cookies.  This helps a website know if the browsing device has visited that or other websites before.  </p>
        <p>Cookies can be used to collect information relating to your use of a website or your device, let you navigate between pages effectively, help to remember your preferences and generally improve your browsing experience.  Cookies can also help ensure advertising you see online is more relevant to you and your interests. </p>
        <p>Cookies can be session or persistent cookies.  Session cookies are temporary and only stay on your browser until you stop browsing.  Persistent cookies stay on your device until they expire or are deleted. </p>
        <p>The cookies used on our website may be first party cookies (i.e. set by us) or third party cookies (i.e. cookies set on our website by a person other than us).  The third party companies that place cookies on our website will have their own privacy policies. </p>
        
        <h3>What types of cookies do we use? </h3>
        <p>The types of cookies used by us, and most websites, can generally be categorised as follows.  </p>
    
        <h3>Strictly necessary cookies </h3>
        <p>These cookies are essential for the full functionality of our website and related services.  They enable you to navigate around our website and services and use their features e.g. accessing secure areas and enabling services that you have asked to receive.

These cookies do not collect information that could be used for marketing purposes. </p>
        
        <h3>Functionality cookies </h3>
        <p>These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features.  e.g. these cookies allow us to remember the settings you have applied to the website (such as font size, preferences or colours), identify whether you are a returning website visitor and present you with a personalised version of the website, or eliminate the need for you to re-enter your login details.  The information these cookies collect is generally anonymous and they do not track your browsing activity on other websites.  These cookies may be first or third party, session or persistent cookies. </p>
        
        <h3>Performance cookies </h3>

        <p>Targeting cookies are used to present advertising that is relevant to you and your interests.  These cookies collect information about your browsing habits e.g. the pages you have visited and the links you have followed across the internet.  They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  These cookies will usually be persistent but time-limited and may be placed on our website by third party service providers or advertising partners with our permission.  </p>
        <p>We use targeting cookies for retargeting.  This is a form of interest-based advertising that enables our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you advertising based on your browsing activity across the internet, including to allow us to advertise to people who previously visited our website. </p>
